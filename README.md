All code used to create simulations for the thesis, along with the dump files from running the simulations can be found in the folder "lammps_scripts". This folder is organised after the parameter that is altered from its default-value, in the simulations. The folder named "Load" thus shows the simulations run with a varying load. For each simulation one can find all dump files, in addition to the files used to create the simulation: granular.in, run.in and myBatch.sh.
